## For the love of Super Mario..
This project started as a CSS assignment at Hove College but the end result was a static one page site with a few CSS animations. 
I decided to make this project into a fully working, responsive website. Built from desktop to mobile. 

Try hover / tapping on the different characters in the sidebar to see an animation.


## ... and CSS 
Project contains 
 - CSS Animations (Keyframes + Transform)
 - CSS Transitions 
 - CSS Psuedo classes (nth-child)
 - CSS Sprites 
 - Media Queries 
 - Box-sizing: Border-Box
 - Box Shadow 
 
 ## and some JavaScript 
 - Menu: Hamburger button / toggle class on button + menu using querySelector and const 
 - Contact page: Form Validation + Adding innerHTML saying "thank you" on submit without refreshing the page (not bug free)
 - News: Toggle to open articles
 - Games: Using a little tricks picked up from #JavaScript30 (Wes Bos) where images slide in when in viewport (Listening for scroll on window).
